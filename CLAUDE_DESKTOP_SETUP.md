# 🎉 Claude Desktop MCP Integration Complete!

## ✅ Setup Complete

Your Swimlanes MCP Server is now configured for Claude Desktop!

### What Was Configured

1. **Claude Desktop Configuration File**
   - Location: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
   - Server name: `swimlanes`

   - ✅ TypeScript compiled to JavaScript
   - ✅ All tools available: `create_swimlane_documentation`, `generate_swimlane_image`, `get_swimlane_image_link`

### How to Use

1. **Restart Claude Desktop** (if it's running) to load the new MCP server
2. **Open any project** you want to analyze
3. **Ask Claude:** "Using the SL_MCP Server, build me swim lane diagrams for this project"

### Example Commands for Claude

```
"Analyze the authentication flow in this codebase and create sequence diagrams using the SL_MCP Server"

"Generate swimlane diagrams for the API endpoints in this service"

"Create architecture diagrams showing the database interactions"

"Build documentation with embedded sequence diagrams for this project"
```

### What Claude Will Do

1. **Analyze your codebase** (any language/framework)
2. **Generate appropriate swimlane syntax** for the flows it finds
3. **Create organized documentation** in `docs/diagrams/` folders
4. **Embed high-quality PNG images** generated via Swimlanes.io
5. **Provide shareable links** for interactive viewing
